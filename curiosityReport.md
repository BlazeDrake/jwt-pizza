# Chaos Testing
## Introduction
I've always felt like I've been good at finding ways to break programs. This is especially true of video games, where I feel like I have a knack for getting things into a buggy state, which generally brings me just as much etnertainment as the game itself.
This is why chaos testing seems like such a fascinating concept to me. Just being let loose on a service, trying to see if you can find any way to break it. Chaos testing is, of course, much more scientific than my attempts to break games. But it is ultimately the same principle, of trying to find which points of failure may put the application in an unusable state

I think it is clear enough why this kind of testing matters. Malicious attacks, such as ddos attacks, are becoming more and more common. These can lead to systems failing. Additionally, systems may just fail due to natural causes, such as a power outage in the location the servers are at. Services should be able to handle these kinds of failures, and the only way to ensure that is through causing those failures.
